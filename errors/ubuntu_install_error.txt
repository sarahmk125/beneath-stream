    commands.CommandError: Diagnostics found a compilation environment issue:

    Could not find <Python.h>. This could mean the following:
      * You're on Ubuntu and haven't run `apt-get install python3-dev`.
      * You're on RHEL/Fedora and haven't run `yum install python3-devel` or
        `dnf install python3-devel` (make sure you also have redhat-rpm-config
        installed)
      * You're on Mac OS X and the usual Python framework was somehow corrupted
        (check your environment variables or try re-installing?)
      * You're on Windows and your Python installation was somehow corrupted
        (check your environment variables or try re-installing?)
